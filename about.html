            <p>The yearbook classroom in high school was my first experience with graphic design and the first time I
                was
                ever addicted to a project. This led me to where I am now, except instead of designing books, I’m
                designing and developing websites. Web development has always felt like a natural extension of my
                passion for layout.</p>
            <p>My husband and I got the chance to move home sooner than expected and I took the opportunity to pause and
                spend a few months really honing my development skills. I wanted to stop fluttering around the edges
                with only a rudimentary knowledge of HTML and CSS and learn not only more languages and frameworks, but
                also how to write clean and solid code. The how and why things work the way they do has always been
                important to me, I like to find the simplest way to complete a project, but I don’t want to weaken the
                work.
            </p>
            <p>I continued by learning JavaScript, React, Redux, Bash, and Git while I was at it. My desire for
                continual learning and improvement hasn’t slowed down and I’m excited to rejoin the workforce with my
                new skills. I’m looking for a similarly energized team to collaborate and work alongside. I thrive in a
                team environment where we push ourselves to work harder and feed off of each others ideas. Progression,
                collaboration, and creativity drive my desire to find a new team in my old home.
            </p>
