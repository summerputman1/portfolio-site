        <p>
          The yearbook classroom in high school was my first experience with
          graphic design and the first time I was ever addicted to a project.
          This led me to where I am now, except instead of designing books, I’m
          designing and developing websites. Web development has always felt
          like a natural extension of my passion for layout.
        </p>
        <p>
          My husband and I got the chance to move home sooner than expected and
          I took the opportunity to pause and spend a few months really honing
          my development skills. I wanted to stop fluttering around the edges
          with only a rudimentary knowledge of HTML and CSS and learn not only
          more languages and frameworks, but also how to write clean and solid
          code. The how and why things work the way they do has always been
          important to me, I like to find the simplest way to complete a
          project, but I don’t want to weaken the work.
        </p>
        <p>
          I continued by learning JavaScript, React, Redux, Bash, and Git while
          I was at it. My desire for continual learning and improvement hasn’t
          slowed down and I’m excited to rejoin the workforce with my new
          skills. I’m looking for a similarly energized team to collaborate and
          work alongside. I thrive in a team environment where we push ourselves
          to work harder and feed off of each others ideas. Progression,
          collaboration, and creativity drive my desire to find a new team in my
          old home.
