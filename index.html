          High school yearbook class was where I discovered what it was to be
          lost in my work. I spent hundreds of hours in the corner classroom on
          an adrenaline high of creating. In the ten years since that first
          taste of excitement, Iâ€™ve been motivating, educating, and pushing
          myself to do more.

            Summer is amazing! She was (and remains) my top design student. Summer
            worked with our marketing team at Texas Tech University Hospitality
            Services for a year where she took the initiative to continue to
            develop her skills. With her relentless motivation and desire to
            learn, Summer will bring a wealth of knowledge and skills to any
            organization that snags her!

            Summer is a creative professional and driven individual. She is able
            to self motivate and direct herself with very little direction or
            leadership needed to produce high end results. She is a team player
            that integrates well with everyone. If you give her a task that she
            has no experience in she quickly dives into educating herself as she
            is as resourceful as they come.

            Summer is an exceptional team player. She is supportive to company
            initiatives and is not afraid to share her ideas and creative
            perspective on a variety of topics. Summer works quickly and
            efficiently . If she doesn't know how to do something she will take
            the initiative to figure it out and produce a quality project or
            product every time. Summer is very professional in her communication
            skills as well. I would recommend Summer to anyone who asks,
            specifically identifying her professionalism and creativity.

            As my former supervisor, Summer Putman led and managed the Marketing
            department with grace and grit. She developed brand design standards
            and led efforts to build a Marketing plan that would drive results
            over the next years. The Marketing department would not have existed
            if she had not taken initiative to build it. She is incredibly driven.
            If you task her with something she doesn't know much about, she will
            put forth every effort in learning and accomplishing that task. She
            inspires those around her to rise to the bar she sets, and encourages
            her teammates to be their best. I could not have asked for a better
            supervisor, and I'm grateful to have worked with such an extraordinary
            person. Summer will make an excellent addition to any team!
